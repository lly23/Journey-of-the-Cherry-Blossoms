Goal: Use a combination of jQuery plugins and your own JS code to create an interactive content slider, a/k/a a click-through or scroll-through graphic. The slider should educate the audience on a topic and/or report on an informative, newsworthy story. It must be built in such a way that it engages users and entices them to read through to the end. It should finish with a quiz or interactive game that tests their knowledge of the topic.

Skills: Your finished app should demonstrate the following:

Great interactive storytelling and storyboarding
A clear understanding of the topic, based on research
Beautiful, responsive design
Effective, efficient use of jQuery and JS
Creativity with a purpose (e.g., the interactive features help tell the story; they aren't added arbitrarily for the sake of 'showing off')
Requirements: Your app must include the following:

A jQuery plugin for the slider itself. It must include at least five (5) slides and provide users with a way to navigate (i.e. go back and forth and skip directly to certain sections). You may use a timeline plugin instead of a slider, but the same rules apply: at least five sections with a way to navigate back and forth in the timeline.
A jQuery plugin for the quiz. 
A slide with a list of Sources (for the information) and Credits (for any third-party photos and graphics). Your sources must be accurate and reliable. While the story can have personal value, it cannot be based solely on your own knowledge and experience. Also, note: the slides for the quiz and sources do not count as two of the five required. 
A third plugin of your choice that enhances the experience. Look around. There are a lot of amazing plugins.
Responsive design. You may use CSS Grid, FlexBox and/or Bootstrap.
